<h3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</h3>
<br>
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, we must follow clean code while programming. Working this way minimizes errors and helps finds errors faster. 

<h3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</h3>
<br>
This project helped me understand databases with MongoDB and apply it to Python code. This course gave me a a different perspective about proramming since this was the first course at SNHU to cover databases with MongoDB.

<h3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</h3>
<br>
Computer scientist makes sure companies have the right program for a specific project that will help solve problems.
